      value: 'This is an artistic portrayal illustrating a Catrina for Dia de los Muertos, set against a muted, dark background adorned with softly glowing candles. The artwork features a woman personifying a traditional Mexican Catrina, with her face painted in intricate skull makeup symbolizing Dia de los Muertos. Her expression is calm and contemplative, with a hint of elegance, and she wears a black embroidered dress with vivid floral designs in orange, pink, and purple. Her hair is styled in long braids, adorned with bright marigold and orange flowers, accented with a striking gold crown composed of radiating spikes. The image, rich in cultural symbolism and vivid color contrasts, evokes a reverent and ceremonial mood. It is a blend of photography and artistic editing, capturing the essence of this significant Mexican celebration.'
