      value: 'The image is a photo depicting a diverse group of people in a church setting, participating in a religious ceremony. The background features soft, neutral colors with white and teal walls, creating a calm and serene atmosphere. The group includes individuals of varying ages, ethnicities, and genders, all engaged in the ceremony with a sense of reverence and focus. A man in the foreground, dressed in a dark suit, appears to be leading a part of the ceremony, possibly passing around a collection plate or similar object. The mood is solemn and respectful, indicative of a shared spiritual or community experience. The lighting is warm and inviting, with strings of lights adding a gentle glow to the scene. The expressions of the participants show concentration and a sense of unity.'
