content: "# Usage of components\r\nThese are general rules on how to use the components, when setting up pages.\r\n\r\n## Hero components\r\nWhen creating hero components use first a \"Hero billboard\" where you inside usually add a text with a bold preline with 150% multiplier, then a left aligned heading with the title, then a text with a subline/description with 150% multiplier. If the user is suppose to click on something, a primary button followed by a normal text with extra info should also be added.\r\n\r\n## Cards\r\n* When using cards, always put them in a section, and always set the columns to an even setting. So if you put 3 cards in main, use 33-33-33, if you put 4 use either 50-50 or 25-25-25-25.\r\n* Cards in sections should always use the \"framed\" card style. Card should never be in a group in a section - it should be directly in the sections.\r\n\r\n## Icon tiles\r\nWhen asked to use icons/icon tiles, put them in a section component with 2 columns (50-50), with section width set to hg:lg:max-w-3/4, make sure the section has padding top and bottom. The 50-50 should always be set even if there are more icon tiles. Always set a heading component in the header slot before them with a text - use 48px and center it. The icons should be in the main slot and usually be the largest icon size and rounded corners.\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n* If not specificied otherwise headings should be left aligned.\r\n* When you can choose different background colors or styles, choose the dark style. Specifically Accent Dark (hg:bg-accent-dark) if available.\r\n* Buttons should always use primary variant.\r\n* When picking images, we prefer graphics, infographics or  over photos.\r\n* We do not use the profile component.\r\n* Blocks/webforms should never have a label - it should be hidden and set to \"\".\r\n* If you are just using CTA or text, do not put it in a section, just place it at root.\r\n* IMPORTANT - DO NEVER EVER CHOOSE hg:bg-brand-light or hg:bg-accent-light."
